# 1 Election System

## Overview

This project demonstrates a real-time election system that integrates data ingestion, streaming, and visualization. The system is designed to handle voting data in real time using Python, Kafka, Spark Streaming, Postgres, and Streamlit. It showcases an end-to-end pipeline that processes votes as they are cast, aggregates the results, and displays them on a real-time dashboard.

### Setup & Execution
1. **Create a Trigger in Azure Data Factory:**
   - Configure a scheduled trigger to run the pipeline at specified intervals.
   - The pipeline performs data extraction, transformation, and loading operations.

2. **Add Data to On-Premise SQL Server:**
   - Insert new records into the source tables to test the pipeline.
   - Verify that data flows through the pipeline and is reflected in Power BI.

3. **Monitor Pipeline Execution:**
   - Use Azure Data Factory's monitoring tools to track the pipeline's progress.
   - Ensure data is processed and loaded correctly into the target systems.

4. **Update Visualizations:**
   - Refresh Power BI reports to verify that new data is accurately represented in the visuals.

### Learnings & Skills
- **ETL Processes:** Mastered end-to-end ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes using Azure tools.
- **Data Transformation:** Implemented multi-layer data transformation techniques with Azure Databricks.
- **Automation:** Configured automated triggers and schedules for data pipelines.
- **Data Integration:** Integrated data from various sources into a unified reporting solution with Power BI.
